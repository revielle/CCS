# Acoustic Scene detection using Audio Classification

Two models implemented: 

Audio (unimodal) classifier vs. Fused Audio-Image (multimodal) classifier

Description of datasets:

The audio dataset used for the audio classifier is part of the DCASE 2017 Challenge Task 1 proposed for Audio Classification, from which 6 indoor categories (library, store, home, metro, and cafe) with 100 individual audio recordings of length of 10 seconds were chosen.

The image dataset for the multi-source classification model is part of the MIT Indoor Scene dataset consisting of indoor images from 67 indoor categories from which we have chosen 6 corresponding categories with a total of 600 images.
